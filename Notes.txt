The @Autowired annotation provides more fine-grained control over where and how autowiring should be accomplished. 

The @Autowired annotation can be used to autowire bean on the setter method just like @Required annotation, constructor,
 a property or methods with arbitrary names and/or multiple arguments.

We can use @Autowired annotation on setter methods to get rid of the <property> element in XML configuration file. 
When Spring finds an @Autowired annotation used with setter methods, it tries to perform byType autowiring on the method.
